Official projects are in RcCarvX.Y.Z files, the ServoControl project, and the ArduinoAndroid42.pde located in the Arduino folder. The rest of the Arduino sketches in the folder serve as tests for various functionalities.

The most recent files have the highest version numbers.
Version 0.5.4 is the current stable version for Iteration 4
Version 0.5 - 0.5.3.1 are stable versions developed during prototyping phases (Between Iterations 2 and 3)

Versions 0.0 - 0.2 are stable versions developed during planning phases (Iteration 2)

The ServoControl Android project and the Arduino sketches are the most up to date files. 





RCCARTest is a test suite of Unit Tests which test the following classes:

Master.java

SlaveActivity.java



Future tests are intended and will be implemented to test the following:

Loss of Bluetooth connection

Proper status of Bluetooth connection



Integration tests will be developed once we have successfully send data

from the Android to the Arduino via the SERIAL port.  Integration tests will

consist of the following:



Upon us successfully setting up the applications, we will hit a button

which launches our test.  The master android will send a series of drive

commands to the slave application, which will then send them to the Arduino

which will instruct the car to move.  There will be a set order and length

of time for these commands.  The phones will indicate successfuly completion.

ServoControl is an Android application that creates a single activity when launched that displays a GUI-based joystick. An OnTouch method sends test byes, the number '42', to the connected Arduino microcontroller when any user input (movement of the joystick) is received. 

The Arduino Uno microcontroller runs the ArduinoAndroid42.pde program and receives the test data passed from the Android device and displays it on a serial output screen. In this case, '42' is displayed every time the Android application receives and sends input to the microcontroller. 



To RUN APPLICATION:



Install RcCar 0.5.4 on two Android devices, ServoControl on one of the devices, and ArduinoAndroid42 on the Arduino Uno microcontroller. 

Run the RcCar 0.5.4 application on each device.

For one device, click "Launch Slave" to launch the slave activity

On the other device, click "Launch Master" to launch the master activity



On the Android running the master activity:

Click one of the 9 buttons to send a command via Bluetooth



On the Android running the slave activity:

The screen updates with the current time in milliseconds that the command was received

The screen updates with the current command that was received via Bluetooth


To test communication between the ServoControl app and the ArduinoAndroid42 sketch, install and run ServoControl on an Android device, and upload the ArduinoAndroid42 sketch to the Arduino microcontroller. Connect the Arduino to the USB host shield and open up a serial terminal in the Arduino IDE. You should see a string of '42's appear on the screen as the user moves his or her finger around on the screen of the Android device.
